 -i Input path. This is where your javascript source code, including
    your source with the main() function, is located.   
    
 -o Output path. This is where your program will be compiled. If this
    is undefined, the output path is assumed to be ../release.
    
 Options: Application Window

 -h Window height, in pixels.

 -w Window width, in pixels.
 
 -t Window title.
 
 Options: Miscellaneous

 -n No execution. Do not execute the binary after compilation.
