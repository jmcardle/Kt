Kt

DESCRIPTION
 Kt is a framework that allows you to develop desktop applications 
 with JavaScript.
 
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 You must have the Qt development tools installed, as well as the
 standard UNIX suite of tools (sed, grep, etc.)

THE KT COMPILER
 Executing the Compiler
 ======================
 ./compiler [OPTIONS]

 Options: Paths
 ==============
 -k Kt path. This is the file path to the Kt framework, which contains
    this file and the source code. By default, the compiler assumes that
    this is the current working directory.
 
 -i Input path. This is where your javascript source code, including
    your source with the main() function, is located.   
    
 -o Output path. This is where your program will be compiled. If this
    is undefined, the output path is assumed to be ../release.
    
 Options: Application Window
 ===========================
 -h Window height, in pixels.

 -w Window width, in pixels.
 
 -t Window title.
 
 Options: Miscellaneous
 ===========================
 -n No execution. Do not execute the binary after compilation.
 
COMPILATION EXAMPLES
 ./compiler -i "examples/hello world" -t "Hello World"

 ./compiler -i "examples/hello world" -n
 
 ./compiler -w 1024 -h 768 -o "../calculator-compiled" \
	-i "examples/calculator" -t "Calculator"

JAVASCRIPT CODE REQUIREMENTS
 Your source code must include a "main.js" file in which a main()
 function is defined. This is the first function that will be executed
 when your application starts.

 The main() function will be called with a single parameter, identifying
 the identifier of the HTML canvas element used by the software to draw
 on. To use the included widgets, you will need to pass this identifier
 to a kCanvas element. Please see the examples for demonstrations.

 Including other source files is achieved by including a line that uses
 the following pattern in your source code:
   //#include "relative/path/to/file.js"
